# rock-paper-scissors
This is a console-played rock-paper-scissors game that I enjoyed developing. I had to look at the code so much that I know what's what line. LOL.

This project tested my knowledge of variables, the appropriate time for them, functions, if and else statements and console.logging to catch bugs causing my code to break.
